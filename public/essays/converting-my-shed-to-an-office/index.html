    <div class="page-intro">
      Lockdown found me in need of an office. Could I turn my shed into a comfortable place to work?
    </div>
    
    
    </header>
    <p>The justification for this tale of folly is that my wife and I are home-working, me permanently and my wife for the next couple of months at least. We don&rsquo;t have enough room in the house for a dedicated space. The closest we have is the conservatory, but for at least half the day it bakes you alive. What we do have is a shed.</p>
<p>Our shed is the standard sized timber-framed thing that you’ll find at the bottom of most British gardens. It’s about ten years old, but has been looked after. I reckoned that I could turn it into a useable office space without much fuss. An article in The Times says that these conversions are known as a &lsquo;shoffice&rsquo; - an amalgamation of shed &amp; office. I am never going to call it that.</p>
<p>Someone famous once said that the best place to start is the beginning. I trundled down to see what my starting point was, then lay down on the floor, curled myself into the fetal position and sobbed quietly.</p>
<p><img src="/images/img_0560-scaled.jpg" alt="Messy shed"></p>
<p>Like any good shed, it&rsquo;s rammed with junk - but a casual survey suggests that the structure is basically sound. The main faults are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a minor leak on the roof</li>
<li>a small hole where a mouse has broken in</li>
<li>some water penetration on the walls where the shiplap has deterioriated</li>
</ul>
<p>I can fix that. The game is on.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-preparation">Step 1: Preparation</h3>
<p>I figured that I have enough knowledge about the fundamentals of building construction to take on a project like this - because I live in a house, and how hard can it be? But I would need some sort of plan, if only to reassure other people that I knew what I was doing. The first step was to commission some detailed technical drawings of the structure and dimensions.</p>
<p><img src="/images/shed-planning.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>With that done, I needed to clear all the junk out. This was a real pain. I decided to dump it in a big pile in the garden. Meanwhile, a significant amount of building materials are piling up in our hallway, increasing the risk that I might have to live in the shed rather than work in it.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-fix-the-roof">Step 1: Fix the roof</h3>
<p>The old felt on the roof was brittle and porous. I replaced it with some brand-spanking-new long-life roofing felt. It would have been easier if I had bought the right amount of felt, saving me an additional trip to Wickes in the middle of a global pandemic, but the actual work was straight-forward, and I am at least 90% confident that it is water-tight.</p>
<p>Cost of materials: Approximately £60</p>
<h3 id="step-2-add-some-windows">Step 2: Add some windows</h3>
<p>My shed didn&rsquo;t have any windows. Sitting in the dark didn&rsquo;t sound much fun, so I ordered two panes of UPVC glazing from a local glass factory. At this point I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I was going to install the glass - so I put that little worry aside for another day.</p>
<p>The next day came and I started worrying about how I was going to install the glass. The basic plan I came up with was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a timber frame on the inside to support the weight of the glass</li>
<li>Cut out two holes</li>
<li>Make external and internal framing to hold the glass in place</li>
</ul>
<p>Cutting the holes in the shed was terrifying, because from that point on it’s no longer a good shed - it’s just a shit building with holes in it. Anyway, after much swearing, cutting and hammering I ended up with two framed holes that looked approximately like windows. In my humble but expert opinion, a good window has two desirable features:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can see out of it</li>
<li>It doesn’t let the outside weather inside</li>
</ol>
<p>I give myself full marks for the first one. The second one is more difficult. There is a technical term we use at work - &lsquo;silicone-the-shit-out-of-it&rsquo; - which translates roughly to fixing something by applying lots and lots of silicone sealant. I installed the glass, framed it, applied lots of silicone and crossed my fingers.</p>

<p>I was able to replace the rotten sections of cladding with bits removed for the windows - a stroke of good luck rather than good planning.</p>
<p>Cost for glass: £28<br>
Cost for other materials: £20</p>
<h3 id="step-3-insulation-and-boarding">Step 3: Insulation and Boarding</h3>
<p>Sheds tend to be a bit cold in the winter, so I insulated the walls and ceiling with 20mm polystyrene sheets and then added a layer of thick polythene to keep moisture out. Polystyrene is awful to work with, but cheap and easy for a weakling like me to carry.</p>
<p>I wanted finished walls, so plasterboard is realistically the only option for the inside. I can’t skim so the plan is to board it, fill the gaps, slap some paint on and hope for the best.</p>
<p><img src="/images/shed-insulation.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This step was time-consuming. Because of the small space, each piece of insulation and plasterboard has to be individually cut to size. I asked a friend help me with the boarding - but he’s the annoying sort that insists that I will only learn if I do things myself, so I didn’t save as much time as much as I had hoped.</p>
<p>With the boards now installed, I filled the gaps with filler, left it to dry and sanded the joints down to create what I hoped (but wasn&rsquo;t) a smooth finish. I also moved the small consumer unit to a better location and reinstalled the light. It&rsquo;s now beginning to look less like a shed and more like a room. I feel like Tim Taylor.</p>

<p>Cost: approx £210 (less approx £100 of donated materials)</p>
<h3 id="step-4-finishing-off">Step 4: Finishing off</h3>
<p>I am relatively happy with myself again by the time I&rsquo;ve finished painting, and the paint has taken to the plasterboard better than I expected. I built a desk and some storage out of CLS timber &amp; plywood, laid down some laminate, installed some skirting, two double sockets, some blinds and called it a day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looked on the last day:</p>

<p>There was a minor technical hitch when I realised that my WiFi doesn’t reach the end of the garden. Well, it does and it doesn’t. Download speeds were great, but upload non-existent. That wouldn’t have bothered me a year ago, but you need a decent amount of upload bandwidth for video calls. I tried Powerline adaptors. They worked, but only at 6mbps (probably because of the distance and the number of circuits). I wasn’t having that when I’ve got a 200mbps connection in the house, so I ran an ethernet cable in.</p>

<p>All done</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had some bad weather over the past week, and no leaks. I&rsquo;m calling it watertight and declaring mission accomplished.</p>
