      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://robertbreen.com&#34;&gt;Robert Breen&lt;/a&gt; has written a nice overview of why he&amp;rsquo;s settled on Craft for his note-taking. We both tried Obsidian before arriving at Craft, and seem to have arrived at  the same conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The RSS Discovery Engine</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#202110-the-rss-discovery-engine</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:53:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#202110-the-rss-discovery-engine</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding personal websites is increasingly difficult. I usually find new people through blog rolls, or word of mouth. That works, to an extent,  but it feels a bit hit and miss. Enormous websites, with carefully crafted SEO, pollute search engine results and make them almost useless for blogs unless you specifically know who you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good things are happening, though. Several web-rings and directories have popped up in recent years that aid serendipitous discovery, and if you’re a regular consumer of RSS, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdengine.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;The RSS Discovery Engine&lt;/a&gt; is a useful tool. Feed it with an RSS feed, and it will crawl through the feed looking for other links that have RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty neat!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 20-page rule</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#202110-the-20-page-rule</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 20:20:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#202110-the-20-page-rule</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From The Guardian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/03/life-writing-mark-billingham-interview&#34;&gt;Mark Billingham&lt;/a&gt;, the writer of the Tom Thorne crime novels. Speaking at Cheltenham literary festival, he said that if a book hadn’t gripped you after 20 pages, then it was OK not just to give up on it but to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mark-billingham-if-youre-not-gripped-in-the-first-20-pages-dont-read-on-twtkt337m&#34;&gt;“throw it across the room angrily”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the sentiment, but twenty pages is quick to judge. My rule is 10% or 100 pages, whichever comes first. If I’m not enjoying it by then, I’ll put it down and know that I&amp;rsquo;ve given it a fair crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always slight regret, though, like it’s my fault for not &lt;em&gt;getting&lt;/em&gt; it. After all, the book got through a bunch of hurdles to get published and so who am I to say it’s crap? But any regret is outweighed by not having to go through the slog of reading a book that I am not enjoying. Reading is supposed to be fun, not a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe throwing it across the room would help..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The perils of productivity systems</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#202110-the-perils-of-productivity-systems</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 15:32:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#202110-the-perils-of-productivity-systems</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alanralph.co.uk/hooked-on-to-do-lists/&#34;&gt;Alan Ralph&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking about ‘productivity’ apps and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s taken me a long time to realise that I need to treat productivity tools and systems like prescribed medication. They’re fine in limited doses and for specific purposes, but overindulgence is risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are apps that might make you more efficient, but that’s not the same as being productive. Productivity isn’t born from a system, or an application. It’s a mindset. It’s good habits. It’s discipline. It’s being aligned with your responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m being unproductive, it isn’t because my system failed, or that my software needs replacing. It’s because I’m tired, or bored, or unhappy. It’s because I ate that massive Cornish Pasty at lunch and my blood sugar is through the roof. It’s because I’d rather be doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be happy with the tools that you use, and there’s nothing wrong with changing up your systems and processes. But at some point you have to stick with something, because any gains in efficiency are lost in the time spent looking for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Six months with the Oculus Quest</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#2021-10-05-six-months-with-the-oculus-quest-2</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 19:38:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#2021-10-05-six-months-with-the-oculus-quest-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve owned my Oculus Quest 2 for around 6 months. Long enough to test its capabilities properly. Here’s my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only previous experience with VR is with the PSVR, which was&amp;hellip; underwhelming. It was heavy, low resolution, had a crazy tethering cable and suffered from the low-power of the decade-old PS4 that was powering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quest 2 is standalone - no PC required. It’s basically a powerful android device, with a high-quality screen (2k per eye), fresnel lenses and infra-red tracking. And it’s £300 - which is a steal when compared to any other consumer VR product. How good could it be? Surprisingly, very good indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC gamers gamers won&amp;rsquo;t be impressed by the graphics. Even so, games like The Climb, Beat Saber &amp;amp; SUPERHOT are a lot of fun, and there is enough content in VR  ‘experiences’ to keep non-gamers entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a great way to watch your own media. The Quest will happily play 4k video from my NAS over Wi-Fi. Find a comfy chair, launch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2497738113633933/?locale=en_GB&#34;&gt;BigScreenVR&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2063931653705427/?locale=en_GB&#34;&gt;Skybox&lt;/a&gt; and you’re transported to your own personal movie theatre with a thirty-foot screen and surround sound. You can even watch 3D video on the cinema screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.jamieadams.click/images/d13a4f6f-71ac-4e3d-ae1f-d0b1f6efc2cd.jpeg&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Watching In the Shadow of the Moon&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracking works well, and you can use your hands in good lighting conditions. Everything seems to fall apart in the dark through. My favourite feature is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d73PfTXZDvo&#34;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, which invites you to draw out a play area and warns if you stray too close to the edge by fading in a star-trek style holographic wall. It’s very cool and means that I can move freely around my room without worrying about knocking the telly over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only a couple of criticisms. First, you need a Facebook account to activate the device. Second, and this is more a criticism of the technology itself rather than of the Quest specifically, the sweet spot (the area that is in focus) of the fresnel lenses is tiny. This means that you need to move your head to look around rather than move your eyes. You get used to it, but it can be irritating. Lastly, you’re always going to look like a complete dork when wearing the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting technology, and now enough to take a punt on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom Domains on iCloud Mail</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#icloud-custom-domains</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#icloud-custom-domains</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the neat things that was quietly announced as part of the iOS 15 rollout is the ability to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212514&#34;&gt;custom domains with iCloud Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a long, self-inflicted and complicated history with email. I self-hosted for many years (stupid, don’t do it), then moved to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.com&#34; title=&#34;Fastmail&#34;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; (too expensive), on to &lt;a href=&#34;https://zoho.eu&#34; title=&#34;Zoho&#34;&gt;Zoho&lt;/a&gt; (too business focussed) and then for the past year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://migadu.com&#34;&gt;Migadu&lt;/a&gt;. Migadu have been great, and I’ve no complaints. It’s a cheap, reliable &amp;amp; no-nonsense service. But moving my domains over to iCloud makes sense because the cost is included in Apple services that I already pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was super-easy, and I was up and running in around fifteen minutes. I’m trialling it with my personal domains for a couple of weeks. If all goes well, I’ll move our communal domain over too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to reduce the amount of stuff that I administer (and pay for), so this has been an unexpected and not unpleasant win.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being a beacon of positivity</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#beacon-of-positivity</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#beacon-of-positivity</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read through some of my old posts. I’m more of a ‘hit and run’ type of blogger, so it’s not something I do very often, if ever. Many of my posts over the past couple of years are on subjects that generate negative emotions (politics, social media) or are negative in sentiment (general moans &amp;amp; gripes). I’m not thrilled about this, so I’ve unpublished everything prior to this year pending review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;crappy-drawing&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.jamieadams.click/images/blog-positivity-graph.svg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has reached heightened levels of toxicity over the past couple of years, and if you are &lt;em&gt;‘very online’&lt;/em&gt; - as many of us are - there is a risk that on-line toxicity &amp;amp; negativity bleeds out into the real world, affecting our well-being, our work, and our relationships. I might play only a tiny part, but it is not my desire to contribute to the global levels of negativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that I can’t write about negative subjects, or that I should become a beacon of positivity, but that I shouldn’t write about negative things just to get them off my chest. While it makes me feel better, it might have the opposite effect on a reader that is already having a bad day. I’m a big believer in people owning their words. I’m owning mine, and taking some back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weights &amp; Measures</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#weights-and-measures</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#weights-and-measures</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two systems of measurement in use in the UK: Imperial and Metric. There is no good reason to use two. That’s just the type of people we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Imperial system uses yards for distance, pounds for weight and gallons for volume. Dividing a ‘yard’ into three gives you a ‘foot’, and one ‘foot’ is divisible by twelve to create an ‘inch’. A mile is 1760 yards (or eight furlongs). A ‘pound’ is divisible by 16 to make an ounce. Going the other way, multiply it by 14 to make a ‘stone’, or by 2000 to make a ‘ton’. A gallon is made up of 8 pints, and pints are divided into fractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sense? No. No, it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metric, which we all know and love, is a decimal system based on meters for measuring distance, kilograms for weight and litres for volume. It’s easy to remember and calculate. One meter is a hundred centimetres. A thousand meters is a kilometre. One thousand millilitres is a litre. All very sensible, and the UK standardised on this system in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good reason to use anything other than metric, but we intermittently use imperial measurements for weight, height and area. Ask anyone in the UK how much they weigh and you’ll get an answer in stones and pounds. Sales brochures for houses display the floor area in square feet. The entirety of our transport system is in imperial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m replacing our bathroom, and I can tell you that the people that manufacture plumbing supplies also missed the news that we switched to metric forty years ago. If I want some pipe, it comes in meters. But if I want to buy a tap connector, it will be in fractions of inches. Occasionally, they mix the two on one product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no way to run a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, if you are reading this essay then congratulations, you are still alive. And if you are alive, then you have either gotten the COVID-19 vaccine, or you still have the opportunity to get the vaccine against COVID-19. And holy fuck, if you aren’t fucking vaccinated against COVID-19, then you need to get fucking vaccinated right now. I mean, what the fuck? Fuck you. Get vaccinated. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fucks are given in the full essay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Digital Footprints</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#on-digital-footprints</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much energy does your digital self consume, and what can you do to minimise it? Scott Nesbit has been thinking about it this week, and it’s worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of energy used for internet applications is staggering. In 2018, Google estimated that a typical search used as much energy as a 60-watt lightbulb does in 17 seconds&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Imagine that, billions of times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the overall environmental impact depends on where the energy comes from. Many data centres in Europe are transitioning to renewable energy, as are our homes with the rise of wind and solar. Regardless, it’s something worth thinking about as we wander around our digital universe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding a stolen scooter with AirTags</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I lose stuff all the time. AirTags are the hi-tech solution from Apple, but I don’t feel like buying another product to micro-manage my deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this tweet from Dan Guido offers an interesting insight into their possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;My scooter was stolen last week. Unknown to the thief, I hid two Airtags inside it. I was able to use the Apple Find My network and UWB direction finding to recover the scooter today. Here’s how it all went down:&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dan Guido (@dguido) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1424921645483966466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stray, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://stray.game/&#34;&gt;Blue Twelve Studio&lt;/a&gt;, looks like a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the highly anticipated video game immerses players in a futuristic metropolis as a lonely, injured feline in search of its family. With the help of a drone named B-12, the sprightly creature has to evade the threats of the dystopian city as it roams the neon-lit alleys, leaps through rundown, graffiti-covered buildings, and nuzzles up to human-like robots.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matt Ruby opines at length on the world before smartphones. It is a lovely chunk of nostalgia, and the whole piece will have a specific age group nodding along in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News was not breaking and I was not alerted. Being elite was a good thing and being a Nazi frowned upon. Scientists were trusted and conspiracy theories were for tinfoil kooks. The only content users generated was letters to the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consumed news once a day by reading a paper that stained my hands. I stumbled upon random articles I would never have selected based on the headline. The ads I saw were untargeted shotgun blasts. Quizzes were just for students and I did not know which ice cream flavor matched my personality, who should play my BFF in a movie of my life, or which Disney prince I should have a threesome with. I rarely got to feel outraged by the words of people I’d never met. For that, I had to rely on family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could use a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more offline in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article in Slate is an excellent guide to spotting the signs that someone is drowning, which looks nothing like you think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly drowned as a child. More than once, actually (I am that dumb). I went too far under with a snorkel, breathed in a lung full of water, and then couldn’t get myself back to the surface. Luckily, a bystander knew the signs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fantastic work from the dev team at the New York Times, showing the extraordinary talent of gymnast Sunisa Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee got into gymnastics when she was 6 years old, after watching videos on YouTube. “Once I started, I just couldn’t stop,” she said. “It looked so fun, and I wanted to try it myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep scrolling up and down and thinking &amp;lsquo;how on earth can someone even do that?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s that saying: &amp;lsquo;the best camera is the one that you have with you&amp;rsquo; - and it&amp;rsquo;s true. I can tell the difference between a shot taken with my iPhone and one taken with my Sony NEX, but the iPhone (or any other phone) is good enough, and it&amp;rsquo;s always with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tens of thousands</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#tens-of-thousands</link>

      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#tens-of-thousands</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are interesting philosophical discussions around whether the costs associated with locking down the economy can be offset by the number who then do not die of COVID-19.  The answer is probably no, but that&amp;rsquo;s a tough sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the bowels of government, someone (or some people) has determined that a certain number of deaths is the pill that has to be swallowed to allow the economy to open up again. They’ve been pretty cagey about what that number is. Prof Andrew Hayward, the head of the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care at University College London, says that it is in the &amp;lsquo;low tens of thousands’ - &lt;em&gt;if we are cautious&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 24 hours, more people tested positive for COVID in the UK than in any other country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zac, at The Tent Peg blog, is writing beautiful essays about his various walks around nice bits of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve bookmarked some for later in the year. It feels like such a long time since I’ve walked up a big hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Terror</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#the-terror</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#the-terror</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Terror is now streaming on BBC iPlayer, three whole years after the US release. I watched the first two episodes tonight and it’s every bit as good as I hoped it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Terror-Dan-Simmons/dp/0593057627/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1618397564&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;novel of the same name&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Simmons which tells a fictionalised account of Sir John Franklin’s expedition to find the North-West Passage. It’s terrifying, but one of my favourite books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.jamieadams.click/images/869EDE2D-1211-4F58-9F6B-B542823E7EE1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;HMS Erebus in the Ice - Francois Musin. 1846.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMS Erebus in the Ice - Francois Musin. 1846.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real story of the expedition is a good tale on its own. Michael Palin has done as good of a job as anyone in putting it down on paper in ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Erebus-Story-Ship-Michael-Palin/dp/184794812X&#34;&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;’, which is well worth a read too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find the decline of organised religion interesting as a sociological phenomenon. What happens when the structure and philosophy underpinning our legal and moral frameworks falls away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church membership in the USA has dipped below 50% for the first time(1). That&amp;rsquo;s a big deal, because the USA is one of the most devoutly Christian countries in the West, and its religious leaders wield a great deal of political influence. The figures reflect what has been happening in the UK for decades—an accelerating decline of membership and attendance across all demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people in the UK self-identifying as Christian stood at 58% in 2011, dropping 12% since 2001(3). The average Church of England service now fills less than thirty seats(2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can agree on why, but I think the following quote is as good an answer as any:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about churches not being able to answer questions clearly; the reality is just that fewer people believe in gods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Matt McConaughey talks to Tim Ferris</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#matt-mcconaughey-talks-to-tim-ferris</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#matt-mcconaughey-talks-to-tim-ferris</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matt McConaughey recorded a wide-ranging interview with Tim Ferris back in October last year. It’s a great listen and confirmed his place on my list of people I would like to have over for dinner. I’d never heard of him until True Detective, then I saw him later the same year in Interstellar and he instantly became one of my favourite actors. He’s an interesting bloke too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, Matt speaks of the importance of introspection as a tool for personal change. He’s kept a journal for over thirty years, and explains how he uses it to help him navigate through life. I’m good at introspection, but I’m not good at acting on it. I’ve kept a journal since 2005. Sometimes I will go weeks without writing in it — but I’m still glad to have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also speaks about the need for society to have shared values, and of politics and politicians not being good delivery vehicles for that sort of thing. I’ve thought about this a lot. Our shared values, traditionally, came from religion — but as religion fades, where do we get those shared values? We’re grappling with this now, but it will become more important in the decades ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fun listen, and worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Valentines Day</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#valentines-day</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The origins of Valentines day as a celebration are thought to have begun with the Roman festival of Lupercalia, where, to celebrate the mythological founders of Rome, the Romans would do very odd things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival involved the sacrifice of a goat and a dog; the goat’s hide would be cut into strips and dipped in its blood, and priests, called Luperci, would then carry these strips and gently slap crop fields and women with them, with the latter being eager for this treatment as they believed that it would make them more fertile in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ancient.eu/Valentine&#39;s_Day/&#34;&gt;Ancient.EU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds more fun than trudging around looking for greetings cards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Not a plant influencer</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#not-a-plant-influencer</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#not-a-plant-influencer</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zanib Hussain Alvi writes of her love of blogs as a part of her &lt;a href=&#34;https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-monday-media-diet-with-zanab&#34;&gt;media diet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last best thing I read was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://daughterofthesoil.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; of some random British woman at the edge of the Cotswolds, writing about cross breeding heritage varieties of peas like Gregor fucking Mendel and how to save seeds to cross breed your own plants. Her last post was two years ago. There’s something about the longer format and distribution or, rather, lack of distribution that makes blogs so special. It was interesting to me because it was interesting to her. I didn’t have to like, subscribe, or make an ongoing commitment to continue to read her blog. She wasn’t selling anything. It felt so refreshing and wholesome to consume information that no one was really trying to actively monetize. She wasn’t trying to be a “plant influencer” but it did reshape what I thought was accessible to me. I have no idea if she’s conventionally attractive, nor do I care. The contrast makes all these apps and their onslaught of notifications seem so absolutely desperate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also get behind her views on podcasts. Why are they all two hours long? Who has the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts have absolutely no respect for my time. Most of them could be five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like everywhere in the country was to get snow except us, but it finally started to fall a couple of days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s going to stick around long, but we’ll enjoy it while it’s here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jamie Todd Rubin laments at length on the variety and complexity of rating systems &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jamierubin.net/2021/02/05/5-star-rating-systems/&#34;&gt;on his blog today&lt;/a&gt;. Here is his suggested rating scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-star: Distraught. Way below my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-stars: Disappointed. I’d expected more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-stars: Satisfied. Met my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-stars: Delighted. Exceeded my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-stars: Blown away. Far exceeded my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it might be slightly in jest, but this is precisely the sort of triviality I can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I get up in the evenin&#39;&lt;br&gt;
And I ain&amp;rsquo;t got nothin&#39; to say&lt;br&gt;
I come home in the mornin&#39;&lt;br&gt;
I go to bed feelin&#39; the same way&lt;br&gt;
I ain&amp;rsquo;t nothin&#39; but tired&lt;br&gt;
Man, I&amp;rsquo;m just tired and bored with myself&lt;br&gt;
Hey there, baby, I could use just a little help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t start a fire&lt;br&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t start a fire without a spark&lt;br&gt;

Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face&lt;br&gt;
Man, I ain&amp;rsquo;t gettin&amp;rsquo; nowhere&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m just livin&#39; in a dump like this&lt;br&gt;

There&amp;rsquo;s a joke here somewhere and it&amp;rsquo;s on me&lt;br&gt;

Come on, baby, this laugh&amp;rsquo;s on me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay on the streets of this town&lt;br&gt;
And they&amp;rsquo;ll be carvin&#39; you up alright&lt;br&gt;
They say you gotta stay hungry&lt;br&gt;
Hey baby, I&amp;rsquo;m just about starvin&#39; tonight&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Papers, please</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#papers-please</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#papers-please</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Racial abuse: Is ending anonymity on social media the answer? &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/pkM7j00dQh&#34;&gt;https://t.co/pkM7j00dQh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ruskin147/status/1356302526715457536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public forums, the evidence shows that anonyminity isn&amp;rsquo;t conducive to good community. Twitter is a toxic mess, mostly because people can hide behind fake names and profile pictures and spunk out whatever is on their mind without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GME day 3</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#gme-day-3</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#gme-day-3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matt Levine continues to write very good copy on the unfathomable things that happen when a bunch of Redditors get involved in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, he lays out some scenarios of how this is likely to play out (one, albeit unlikely, being the collapse of capitalism), but it sounds like it’s not easy to predict, even for those that do this stuff for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just the case, just inevitably the case, that if you are going to have financial markets that are optimized for those purposes—that are liquid and complete, that attract smart people, that are open to everyone—they are also going to have a certain amount of nonsense. It’s not like WallStreetBets invented financial nonsense! Financial-market nonsense is, like, 70% of what we talk about around here on a normal day. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-18/sinful-derivatives-have-their-uses&#34;&gt;How&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-23/maybe-companies-will-get-rid-of-cds&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-25/regulators-don-t-enjoy-cds-games&#34;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-15/sometimes-cds-is-on-the-wrong-company&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-13/credit-default-swaps-get-weird-after-sears-bankruptcy&#34;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-05/neiman-marcus-does-some-cds-stuff-too&#34;&gt;have written&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-01/another-weird-deal-upsets-cds-traders&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloombergquint.com/view/blackstone-may-do-its-cleverest-cds-trade-again&#34;&gt;hedge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-28/credit-derivatives-bring-people-together&#34;&gt;funds&lt;/a&gt; tricking each other using credit default swaps? Financial markets exist to foster price discovery and capital formation, but the way they do that is mostly by letting smart people mess with each other all day. WallStreetBets is a new class of smart people messing, quite effectively, with the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Levine / Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know nothing about the stock market, and I&amp;rsquo;m not making any judgement on whether all this is good or bad, but it is absolutely fascinating and at least a tiny bit funny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#that-is-a-thing-that-you-can-do</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Money Stuff&amp;rdquo; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, on what happened when /r/wallstreetbets directed their collective might on Gamestop, precipitating &lt;em&gt;$17 billion dollars&lt;/em&gt; of stock trades and inflating the stock by 180%:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here (via &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/22761987.263578/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9Sb2JpbldpZ2cvc3RhdHVzLzEzNTM3ODM0ODE2NDY2NTc1Mzg/600ff07e6413780742239610B7447144c&#34;&gt;Robin Wigglesworth&lt;/a&gt;) is &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/22761987.263578/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL3dhbGxzdHJlZXRiZXRzL2NvbW1lbnRzL2w0c2czdS9jYW5faV9nZXRfYV9mbGFpcl9mb3JfYnV5aW5nX2dtZV9hdF90aGVfbGl0ZXJhbC9na3FmZ3NwLw/600ff07e6413780742239610Bcc9ac1b3&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets forum asking “Can I get a flair for buying GME at the literal top ($155.29)?” (It was not the literal top, but close.) “This is the way,” a chorus of redditors replied. It is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; way! Gleefully getting top-ticked on a stock—buying it at its highest price ever and then bragging about it as the price collapses—in order to earn the strange respect of your friends on Reddit: That is a thing you can do. You might enjoy it. I am not going to say it is irrational; people have spent their money on worse things. But it is not the sort of rationality that the stock market is set up for. “When stock prices get too high, sensible value motives will take over”: Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock exchange is weird. People on the internet are weirder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internet users of a certain age might remember Tucows as the place that you would go to download pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that they are still about, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tucows.com/retired/&#34;&gt;and doing well&lt;/a&gt;. They have just retired the download site after 25 years of operation – but they also own Hover, Enom &amp;amp; Ting; and are the second largest domain registrar in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cool that they&amp;rsquo;ve weathered the storms and stuck around.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Collecting, for the fun of it</title>

      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#collecting-for-the-fun-of-it</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Britain is a nation of collectors. From stamps to coins and military regalia — most folk know someone who collects &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I had a collection of StarTrek collectibles that I was quite pleased with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It surprised me to learn that there are people that collect bricks. Not gold bricks, &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; bricks - the kind houses are built with. Bricks are worthless. Their ultimate destiny is to be ground to rubble and used as hardcore. So, why collect them? I enjoyed organising my Star Trek cards, and these guys - I assume that are guys - enjoy bricks. Happiness makes the world go round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.jamieadams.click/images/DraggedImage.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jason Harris’s haul of bricks. (Jason Harris, T-Space architects)&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success, whether massive or modest, shouldn’t be the goal of any experiment that you undertake. The goal can, and perhaps always should, be to learn something new. And, by extension, to learn something about yourself at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments don’t have to be grand in scope and scale. It’s obvious, really, but easy to forget.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The blogging revolution will be delivered to your inbox</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#the-blogging-revolution-will-be-delivered-to-your-inbox</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#the-blogging-revolution-will-be-delivered-to-your-inbox</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew that if I kept blogging for long enough that it would become fashionable again, and it is, sort of, but not in the way that I imagined. While more people are blogging from their own domain — which is fabulous — an enormous number of people are choosing newsletter platforms like Substack and Buttondown instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging isn’t easy. Ask for advice on the internet and you’ll end up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innocent: &lt;em&gt;“Oh, hi. I&amp;rsquo;d like to start a blog. Can you help?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerd: &lt;em&gt;“No problem. That’s easy! Just connect your GitHub account to Netlify and run a custom build pipeline from Hugo and some markdown files”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is a technical and creative endeavour, requiring a whole host of different skills, a large amount of time, and for most people no recompense other than the joy of doing it. It&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsletter startups have solved the problems of difficulty and monetisation, so if people find that newsletters are the best way to distribute their content, and get paid for it (if they want to), then more power to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New to the world of newsletters? Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of my favourites to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://helenlewis.substack.com/p/the-bluestocking-vol-169&#34;&gt;The Bluestocking&lt;/a&gt;, by Helen Lewis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/&#34;&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt;, by Ryan Broderick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com&#34;&gt;Letters from an American&lt;/a&gt;, by Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soverybeautiful.org/&#34;&gt;Life is so Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;, by Hugh Hollowell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff?source=NLshare&#34;&gt;Money Stuff&lt;/a&gt;, by Matt Levine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS aficionados will be pleased to know that both Buttondown and Substack provide RSS feeds by default, though my preference is to subscribe via my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.newsblur.com/post/146752875548/newsletters-in-your-newsblur&#34;&gt;NewsBlur email address&lt;/a&gt; so that authors know they&amp;rsquo;ve got a reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nearly 40</title>
      <link>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#nearly-40</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://static.jamieadams.click/stream/#nearly-40</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll be forty in a few months. When I was young, I couldn’t imagine what being forty years old would be like. It seems like such a large and distant number. But it feels smaller now that it approaches, and I’m not particularly fussed about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, someone asked an open question Hacker News - &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24527978&#34;&gt;What is it like to be old?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; among the hundreds of responses was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Once you hit 40 you start feeling random pains in places. Sometimes pretty intense pain. Your doctor will have no idea what caused it and tell you it&amp;rsquo;s normal, but let them know if it happens again. And after a while you&amp;rsquo;ll just stop telling them, because it&amp;rsquo;s just a thing that happens now&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, at least I haven’t got that to deal with,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I woke up unable to raise my arm above chest level. My elbow is red, hot &amp;amp; swollen with fluid. I didn’t bang or stress it—it just decided that it would not play its usual role for me today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I guess this is how it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Has America always been a bit strange, or is it a new thing? To me it feels like a new thing, but I’m starting to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, one of the large panes of glass in our french doors exploded. There was no external impact. It just gave up on life. That, I thought, just finishes the year perfectly. A final &lt;em&gt;fuck you&lt;/em&gt; from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many words have been written and will be written, about what a crap year 2020 has been. For me, putting aside externalities, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been as bad as it could have been. I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the get-togethers, cinema, museums and country houses. But there was also much to be glad about: our eldest daughter moving away to university, getting a job and revealing that she can function as a human without our input or opinions; switching jobs and recovering some sanity, building a space of my own, driving less and walking more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus changed our lives in ways that were unimaginable twelve months ago. New behaviours are so entrenched that our youngest daughter remarked on how strange it is that none of the characters on Animal Crossing practice social distancing, or wear a mask. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; normal being replaced by the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hugely grateful to the bloggers that plug away at their sites week in, week out. I’m grateful for the brief glimpses into your lives and the knowledge that while we&amp;rsquo;re all going through same thing, we deal with it in our own ways. I&amp;rsquo;ve made an effort to reach out and tell you that. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue doing the same in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no willpower and fragile self-esteem, so there are no goals or resolutions for next year. What will be, will be, and it will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
