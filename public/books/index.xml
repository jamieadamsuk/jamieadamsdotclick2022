      <title>The Best of Me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s David Sedaris. The best bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read most of these before, but David Sedaris is someone that is worth re-reading. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, some touching ones, and many where I put my hand to my mouth, thinking: &lt;em&gt;Did he actually just say that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the book to give someone who has never read a Sedaris essay before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book was just what I needed. It&amp;rsquo;s cheesy, full of sterotypes and has plot holes that you could fly a jumbo jet through - but it was &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; and just rolled along.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</title>
      <link>https://hinged.blog/stream/#the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hinged.blog/stream/#the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March is such a fickle month. It is the seam between winter and spring—though. [Loc: 160]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pauses at MEMOIR, studying the titles on the spines, so many I’s and Me’s and My’s, possessive words for possessive lives. What a luxury, to tell one’s story. To be read, remembered. [Loc: 1398]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He runs his hand through Robbie’s hair. Dry, it is the color of burnt sugar, a tawny shade somewhere between brown and red, depending on the light. [Loc: 1554]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing that picture and realizing that photographs weren’t real. There’s no context, just the illusion that you’re showing a snapshot of a life, but life isn’t snapshots, it’s fluid. So photos are like fictions. [Loc: 4188]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has seen maps of course, but ink and paper hold nothing to this. To the salt smell, the murmur of waves, the hypnotic draw of the tide. To the scope and scale of the sea, and the knowledge that somewhere, beyond the horizon, there is more. [Loc: 5408]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addie was raised to kneel in the little stone chapel in the center of Villon, spent days folded into Paris pews. She has listened to the bells, and the organ, and the calls to prayer. And yet, despite it all, she has never understood the appeal. How does a ceiling bring you closer to heaven? If God is so large, why build walls to hold Him in? [Loc: 5462]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hate war,” he says darkly. “I would have thought you fond of conflict.” “The aftermath breeds art,” he says. “But war makes believers out of cynics. Sycophants desperate for salvation, everyone suddenly clinging to their souls, clutching them close like a matron with her finest pearls.” [Loc: 6480]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kiss, like a piece of long-awaited punctuation. Not the em dash of an interrupted line, or the ellipsis of a quiet escape, but a period, a closed parenthesis, an end. [Loc: 7766]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Silence</title>
      <link>https://hinged.blog/stream/#the-silence</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cataclysmic event (we never find out what - solar flair? nuclear explosion?) has rendered all technology useless. It’s a subject that many writers have explored before, but if anyone can spin a good yarn out of it, surely highly decorated author Don DeLillo can. No. Instead, we have a book that is boring, pretentious and feels too long at 128 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dishonesty is the Second-Best Policy</title>
      <link>https://hinged.blog/stream/#dishonesty-is-the-second-best-policy</link>

      <guid>https://hinged.blog/stream/#dishonesty-is-the-second-best-policy</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The book is a collection of his newspaper columns, and so comes across as dated in places, but his cynical observations on the perversity of modern life are, for me, always worth a read. You either like David Mitchell, or you don&amp;rsquo;t, and will probably fall firmly into one of those camps. Guardian reading lefties will love it. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of books on the writing process, but this is a fun read and one that I&amp;rsquo;ll keep dipping back into.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a sucker for a good first contact story, but found this one underwhelming. The premise was good, but I didn’t gel with the protagonist at all. The author is not frugal with her words, and some of the descriptive passages had me looking for the telephone number of her editor. It’s listed as the first book in a series, but I can’t see me buying any of the others. It has a good rating on Amazon, though, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of people are given the opportunity to live in a pristine wilderness. They must survive while leaving no trace on their surroundings. This is a fantastic book, and beautifully written. At two points it literally moved me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salt was the thing that lasted the longest. And after it was gone they discovered that real food tastes like dirt, water, and exertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t insist on a detailed explanation. One of our signature flaws as a species: we will risk almost anything to avoid looking stupid. [Loc: 2989]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even though Oskar knew all of this to be correct and knew Kaspersky was in the right, he still wanted to throw his shoe at the screen. Why are the righteous so often irritating? [Loc: 3018]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s possible to both know and not know something.’ [Loc: 3234]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they were citizens of a shadow country that in his previous life he’d only dimly perceived, a country located at the edge of an abyss. He’d been aware of the shadowland forever, of course. He’d seen its more obvious outposts: shelters fashioned from cardboard under overpasses, tents glimpsed in the bushes alongside expressways, houses with boarded-up doors but a light shining in an upstairs window. He’d always been vaguely aware of its citizens, people who’d slipped beneath the surface of society, into a territory without comfort or room for error. [Loc: 3581]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to disappear in the space between countries. [Loc: 3654]&lt;/p&gt;
