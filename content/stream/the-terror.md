The Terror is now streaming on BBC iPlayer, three whole years after the US release. I watched the first two episodes tonight and it’s every bit as good as I hoped it would be.

It’s based on the [novel of the same name](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Terror-Dan-Simmons/dp/0593057627/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1618397564&sr=1-1) by Dan Simmons which tells a fictionalised account of Sir John Franklin’s expedition to find the North-West Passage. It’s terrifying, but one of my favourite books.

HMS Erebus in the Ice - Francois Musin. 1846.

The real story of the expedition is a good tale on its own. Michael Palin has done as good of a job as anyone in putting it down on paper in ‘[Erebus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Erebus-Story-Ship-Michael-Palin/dp/184794812X)’, which is well worth a read too.
