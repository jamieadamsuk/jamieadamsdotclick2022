title: Custom Domains on iCloud Mail

One of the neat things that was quietly announced as part of the iOS 15 rollout is the ability to use [custom domains with iCloud Mail](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212514).

I have a long, self-inflicted and complicated history with email. I self-hosted for many years (stupid, don’t do it), then moved to [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com "Fastmail") (too expensive), on to [Zoho](https://zoho.eu "Zoho") (too business focussed) and then for the past year, [Migadu](https://migadu.com). Migadu have been great, and I’ve no complaints. It’s a cheap, reliable & no-nonsense service. But moving my domains over to iCloud makes sense because the cost is included in Apple services that I already pay for.

The process was super-easy, and I was up and running in around fifteen minutes. I’m trialling it with my personal domains for a couple of weeks. If all goes well, I’ll move our communal domain over too.

I’m trying to reduce the amount of stuff that I administer (and pay for), so this has been an unexpected and not unpleasant win.
