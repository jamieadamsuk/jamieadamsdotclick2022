In his latest post, Giles [talks about why RSS rocks](https://gilest.org/rss-feels.html):

> To me, using RSS feeds to keep track of stuff I’m interested in is a good use of my time. It doesn’t feel like a burden, it doesn’t feel like I’m being tracked or spied on, and it doesn’t feel like I’m just another number in the ads game.

Yup.

Our workflow is roughly the same. I use Feedbin, then send interesting stuff over to pocket and dip in and out through the day. That's the great thing about RSS: it puts YOU in control.
