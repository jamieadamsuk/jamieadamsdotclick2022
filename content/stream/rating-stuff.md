Jamie Todd Rubin laments at length on the variety and complexity of rating systems [on his blog today](https://www.jamierubin.net/2021/02/05/5-star-rating-systems/). Here is his suggested rating scale:

> 1-star: Distraught. Way below my expectations.
> 
> 2-stars: Disappointed. Iâ€™d expected more.
> 
> 3-stars: Satisfied. Met my expectations.
> 
> 4-stars: Delighted. Exceeded my expectations.
> 
> 5-stars: Blown away. Far exceeded my expectations.

I think it might be slightly in jest, but this is precisely the sort of triviality I can get behind.
