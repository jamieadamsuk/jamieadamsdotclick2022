Britain is a nation of collectors. From stamps to coins and military regalia — most folk know someone who collects _something_. I had a collection of StarTrek collectibles that I was quite pleased with. 

It surprised me to learn that there are people that collect bricks. Not gold bricks, _building_ bricks - the kind houses are built with. Bricks are worthless. Their ultimate destiny is to be ground to rubble and used as hardcore. So, why collect them? I enjoyed organising my Star Trek cards, and these guys - I assume that are guys - enjoy bricks. Happiness makes the world go round.
