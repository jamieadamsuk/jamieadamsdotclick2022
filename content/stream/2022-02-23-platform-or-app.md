Interesting that the Guardian [defines Telegram](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/ex-councillor-william-coleshill-thrown-out-tory-party-among-mob-starmer-incident-resistance-gb) as a social media platform, rather than a messaging app.  A quick google search shows that this definition has been used as far back as 2016, but more frequently since 2020 and more often than any of its peers, such as Whatsapp & Signal.

Why the distinction?
