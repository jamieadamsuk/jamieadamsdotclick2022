Finding personal websites is increasingly difficult. I usually find new people through blog rolls, or word of mouth. That works, to an extent,  but it feels a bit hit and miss. Enormous websites, with carefully crafted SEO, pollute search engine results and make them almost useless for blogs unless you specifically know who you are looking for.

Good things are happening, though. Several web-rings and directories have popped up in recent years that aid serendipitous discovery, and if youâ€™re a regular consumer of RSS, [The RSS Discovery Engine](https://rdengine.herokuapp.com) is a useful tool. Feed it with an RSS feed, and it will crawl through the feed looking for other links that have RSS feeds.

Pretty neat!
