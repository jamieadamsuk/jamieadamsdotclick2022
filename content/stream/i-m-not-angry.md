I’m not angry that Boris Johnson was quaffing birthday cake and hosting cheese & wine parties while the rest of us were bound to our homes. I mean, it’s not great, but what did people expect? Boris is a known quantity. He’s been in the public eye for over thirty years. His entire career has been one of failing upwards with the grace of a drunken cow. I’m envious, really. If I was consistently that shit, I’d be homeless. Boris is Prime Minister. It’s astonishing. Something for the young folk to aspire to, even.

When asked my opinion, I give a non-committal shrug. I don’t care. I wouldn’t be surprised if Boris Johnson picked up the Downing Street cat and drop kicked it across the road. If he announced that he’d just disposed of the limp corpse of Michael Gove through the office shredder, then I might elicit a small ‘huh’. I’m just tired of hearing his name. The lies, as ridiculous and trivial as they often are, no longer surprise. The word ‘party’ has become a sound, devoid of meaning.

I suspect many feel the same. But indifference is dangerous, and none of this is normal. We deserve better, and it's right to be angry.
