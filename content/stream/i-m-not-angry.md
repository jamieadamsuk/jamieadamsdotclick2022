title: "I'm not angry"
---
So, Boris Johnson was quaffing birthday cake and hosting cheese & wine parties while the rest of us were bound to our homes. I mean, it’s not great, but  Boris is a known quantity: he's a bad Prime Minister and a terrible human being. We should expect no less. His entire career has been one of failing upwards with the grace of a drunken cow. I’m envious, really. If I was consistently that shit, I’d be homeless. Boris is Prime Minister! 

When asked my opinion, I give a non-committal shrug. I wouldn’t be surprised if Boris Johnson picked up the Downing Street cat and drop kicked it across the road. If he announced that he’d just disposed of the limp corpse of Michael Gove through the office shredder, then I might voice a small ‘huh’. The lies, as ridiculous and trivial as they often are, no longer surprise. The word ‘party’ has become a sound, devoid of meaning.

I'm not angry at Boris Johnson. I'm frustrated that we have systems that allow people like him to end up as Prime Minister.
