Zanib Hussain Alvi writes of her love of blogs as a part of her [media diet](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-monday-media-diet-with-zanab):

> The last best thing I read was the [blog](https://daughterofthesoil.blogspot.com/) of some random British woman at the edge of the Cotswolds, writing about cross breeding heritage varieties of peas like Gregor fucking Mendel and how to save seeds to cross breed your own plants. Her last post was two years ago. There’s something about the longer format and distribution or, rather, lack of distribution that makes blogs so special. It was interesting to me because it was interesting to her. I didn’t have to like, subscribe, or make an ongoing commitment to continue to read her blog. She wasn’t selling anything. It felt so refreshing and wholesome to consume information that no one was really trying to actively monetize. She wasn’t trying to be a “plant influencer” but it did reshape what I thought was accessible to me. I have no idea if she’s conventionally attractive, nor do I care. The contrast makes all these apps and their onslaught of notifications seem so absolutely desperate. 

I can also get behind her views on podcasts. Why are they all two hours long? Who has the time?
