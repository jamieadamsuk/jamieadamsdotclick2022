[This profile in Protocol](https://www.protocol.com/matt-mullenweg) is a great insight into what motivates one of the more interesting people in technology.

Most people wouldn't know who Matt is. He is the CEO of Automattic; maker of WordPress, the internet publishing powerhouse, and steward of several other services you might have heard of: Day One, Tumblr & WooCommerce to name just a few.

Matt’s commitment to ‘open’ through WordPress saved RSS from extinction, while others (looking at you Mozilla) made short-term business decisions at the expense of open protocols.

Worth ten minutes of your time.
