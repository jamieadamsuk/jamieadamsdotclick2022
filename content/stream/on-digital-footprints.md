How much energy does your digital self consume, and what can you do to minimise it? Scott Nesbit has been thinking about it this week, and it’s worth a read. 

The amount of energy used for internet applications is staggering. In 2018, Google estimated that a typical search used as much energy as a 60-watt lightbulb does in 17 seconds[^1]. Imagine that, billions of times over.

Of course, the overall environmental impact depends on where the energy comes from. Many data centres in Europe are transitioning to renewable energy, as are our homes with the rise of wind and solar. Regardless, it’s something worth thinking about as we wander around our digital universe.
