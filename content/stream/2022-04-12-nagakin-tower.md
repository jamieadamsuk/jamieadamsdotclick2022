title: "Farewell to Nakagin Tower"

Sadly, demolition work will begin on Nakagin Tower this week. I have written of my admiration of the building before. Constructed in 1972, it took just 30 days to erect the two service towers and install the 140 prefabricated capsules that make up the residential accommodation. The capsules were to be rotated out every 25 years - but that never happened and now the entire structure is in an advanced state of decay.
