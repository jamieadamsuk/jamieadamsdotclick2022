title: "Not that smart"
---

Our Samsung TV is over ten years old. It’s only 1080p and doesn’t have any ‘smart’ features, but we don’t watch a massive amount of TV, so that’s just fine. I expect it will last us a few more years.

TVs are a bit like beds or washing machines, in that you only buy a few of them throughout your lifetime. There will be a small amount of people upgrading regularly, but usually you only buy a new TV if the old one breaks, or becomes obsolete. That poses a problem for manufacturers, because there is an upper limit on the number of TVs that you can sell. 

Now that TVs connect to Wi-Fi, an additional revenue stream opens in the way of advertisements. Samsung has been doing it for a while now, and makes a bunch of money. Now [LG is getting into the game](https://gizmodo.com/lg-s-latest-announcement-solidifies-everything-wrong-wi-1848425315).

This bothers me. We’ve kind of accepted that we don’t have to pay hard cash to use Facebook and Google, and all the rest, and that instead we give them some personal data so that they can sell adverts. But TVs cost _real money_, and they ain’t cheap. Users shouldn’t be milked for their personal data, too.

It’s increasingly difficult to buy a non-smart TV, so your only options are to never connect it to the internet (impossible on a Samsung), use router level DNS blocking (until the TVs start using encrypted DNS) or connect something like an Apple TV and use that exclusively.
