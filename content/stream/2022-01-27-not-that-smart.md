title: "Not that smart"
---

Our Samsung TV is over a decade old. It replaced an enormous rear-projection TV, that was also around a decade old. It's only 1080p and doesn’t have any ‘smart’ features, but since we don’t watch a massive amount of TV, that’s just fine. I expect it to last a while yet.

How many TVs have you ever bought? Likely not many. You only buy a new one if the old one breaks, or becomes obsolete. That poses a problem for manufacturers, because there is an upper limit on the number of TVs that they can sell. 

Now that TVs connect to Wi-Fi, an additional revenue stream opens in the way of advertisements. Samsung has been selling ad space on their smart TVs for a while, and makes a bunch of money from it. Now [LG is getting into the game](https://gizmodo.com/lg-s-latest-announcement-solidifies-everything-wrong-wi-1848425315).

This bothers me. We’ve kind of accepted that we don’t have to pay hard cash to use Facebook and Google - and all the rest - and that instead we give them some personal data so that they can sell adverts. But TVs cost _real money_, and they ain’t cheap.

It’s increasingly difficult to buy a non-smart TV, so your only options are to never connect it to the internet (impossible on a Samsung), use router level DNS blocking (until the TVs start using encrypted DNS) or connect something like an Apple TV and use that exclusively.
