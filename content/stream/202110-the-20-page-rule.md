From The Guardian:

> [Mark Billingham](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/03/life-writing-mark-billingham-interview), the writer of the Tom Thorne crime novels. Speaking at Cheltenham literary festival, he said that if a book hadn’t gripped you after 20 pages, then it was OK not just to give up on it but to [“throw it across the room angrily”](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mark-billingham-if-youre-not-gripped-in-the-first-20-pages-dont-read-on-twtkt337m).

My rule is 10% or 100 pages, whichever comes first. If I’m not enjoying it by then, I’ll put it down and know that I've given it a fair crack. 

There is always a feeling of regret, though, like it’s my fault for not *getting* it.  But any regret is outweighed by not having to go through the slog of reading a book that I am not enjoying. Reading is supposed to be fun, not a chore.
