These templates are are designed for use on 10.3 inch e-ink panels, like those used on the Ratta Supernote, Remarkable 2 and Boox Note Air - but I guess they'll work on anything with similar screen dimensions.

They're created for my own needs, but hopefully somone else can get some use out of them too.
