Thought I’d try the Weeknotes thing again..

On Wednesday, a cable failure ruined my day. The defective cable severed the connection between the Rasbperry Pi that serves as our DHCP & DNS server and its storage device, meaning that there was no internet for anyone. Emma and I were due in Teams meetings before 10am, so what would normally be an inconvenience turned into a minor crisis. I’ve thus decided that I absolutely cannot be arsed with advanced networking and put it out of service. 

The device also served as our Plex media server. To be honest, this is no major loss. The Pi didn’t make a good media server. But I need my movies, so what to do?

This website is hosted on a dedicated server in France (258 miles away from home, as the crow flies, and 20ms). It has 8gb ram, 2 terabytes of storage and sits idle most of the time. Can you host Plex on a VPS in another country and stream from it reliably? It turns out that you can. The biggest hassle was getting 750gb of media across a small ocean. I puzzled over this for a while, before remembering that I have Resilio Sync licence and it was plain sailing from there.

I had no work related travel this week, so was experiencing mild cabin fever by the time Friday rolled around. My desire to meet with other humans became so strong that I was almost deliriously happy to attend an unrelated child’s birthday party on Saturday afternoon.

### Reading:

Slow Horses, by Mick Heron. 

### Watching:

1. I watched all three seasons of [The Detectorists](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b06l51nr/detectorists), because I'm in that sort of mood.
2. We're slowly making our way through [The Morning Show](https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/the-morning-show/umc.cmc.25tn3v8ku4b39tr6ccgb8nl6m). I’m not sure what to make of it so far, but it is well produced and there is something about it that keeps us coming back. Billy Cruddup is outstanding.

### Quick Links:

    I'm not really a party sort of person, but even if I were, I would not want to be at The Brits. - [Brit Awards 2022: What It's Like to Attend as a Non-Celeb (vice.com)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgd4ka/brit-awards-2022-guests-tickets-experience?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
2. _“I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots of services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process.”_

Well, that wasn’t so hard.
