There is a lot going on in this book. A ponzi scheme (that bares a remarkable semblance to the Bernie Madoff scheme), a musically talented addict, a trophy wife adjusting to changed circumstances and a beautiful hotel in the remote Canadian wilderness - but somehow, almost unbelievably, it stays coherent.

> But they were citizens of a shadow country that in his previous life he’d only dimly perceived, a country located at the edge of an abyss. He’d been aware of the shadowland forever, of course. He’d seen its more obvious outposts: shelters fashioned from cardboard under overpasses, tents glimpsed in the bushes alongside expressways, houses with boarded-up doors but a light shining in an upstairs window. He’d always been vaguely aware of its citizens, people who’d slipped beneath the surface of society, into a territory without comfort or room for error. \[Loc: 3581\]
