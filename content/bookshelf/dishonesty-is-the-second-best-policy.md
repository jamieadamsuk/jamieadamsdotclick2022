The book is a collection of his newspaper columns, and so comes across as dated in places, but his cynical observations on the perversity of modern life are, for me, always worth a read. You either like David Mitchell, or you don't, and will probably fall firmly into one of those camps. Guardian reading lefties will love it. Probably.
