This book was controversial because the protagonists, siblings who are locked away in an attic for years, fall in love. But that’s only a small part of the story, and I’m not sure why it got all the attention that it did. It’s not gratuitous or erotic, and happens over just a few pages.

It’s not a very good book. It’s full of cliches, plot holes and _really_ bad writing - but there is something about it that kept me turning the pages. If I had to put it in a genre, it would be ‘gothic trash’. It was a fun read.
