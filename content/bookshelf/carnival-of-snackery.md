In some ways, David Sedaris is very relatable. Well, as relatable as someone who works in a garden shed can be to a multi-millionaire, multi-home owning, best-selling author. He says things out loud that I would only say in my head, but it’s nice to know that someone else has these terrible thoughts, too. Enabling, even, in times where people are scared to offend.

Ultimately, this isn’t as enjoyable as the previous diaries. The highlights, as always, are the interactions with his family and his ascerbic observations of the people that he meets. Sadly, he dedicates vast swathes of the book to his talks, plane journeys and hotel stays; which basically makes it a shit travel journal.
