A cataclysmic event (we never find out what - solar flair? nuclear explosion?) has rendered all technology useless. It‚Äôs a subject that many writers have explored before, but if anyone can spin a good yarn out of it, surely highly decorated author Don DeLillo can. No. Instead, we have a book that is boring, pretentious and feels too long at 128 pages.
