It is said that everything that has come before will happen again. That’s basically the premise of this book. The theory is that if you pick out the most successful empires over, say, the last thousand years, and examine what led to their downfall, that you might come up with a set of indicators, or patterns, that can predict the fate of current societies. On the face of it, it’s all rather compelling. 

Our lives are brief, and periods of prosperity and stability are long, so we have a distorted view of how long empires and societies exist. They aren’t around for long at all, and they all come to a messy end through civil war (common), war (sometimes) or natural disasters (rarely). BUT, good news, civil wars are often short in the grand scheme of things and eventually lead back to peace & prosperity - for a while at least - and the upward trend of human progress, on a macro scale, continues with just a little blip.

America, by all the metrics, is careering towards civil war. I mean, we can see that with our own eyes, but it’s interesting to see it as part of a grand tale of empires. But, more good news, it doesn’t have to be this way! America is an advanced, reasonably well-educated country. Since we have a good idea of what causes societal instability, they can stop it! It will take a coordinated effort, across the political spectrum, to radically reform government institutions, rapidly (like, _right now_) reduce wealth inequality and ensure that people can trust government to deliver what they need. But it can be done!

Haha.

This is a good book, and accessible given the complex subject matter. You might disagree with the conclusions, but the historical overviews are interesting on their own.
