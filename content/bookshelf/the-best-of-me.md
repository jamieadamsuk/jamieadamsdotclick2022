It’s David Sedaris. The best bits.

I’ve read most of these before, but David Sedaris is someone that is worth re-reading. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, some touching ones, and many where I put my hand to my mouth, thinking: _Did he actually just say that?_

This would be the book to give someone who has never read a Sedaris essay before.
