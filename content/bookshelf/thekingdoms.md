Good time-slip stories are few and far between, perhaps because it's difficult to maintain suspension of disbelief when writing about something as esoteric as time travel. Stephen King gets it right in [11/22/63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11/22/63). Natasha Pulley gets it right here. A fabulous book.
