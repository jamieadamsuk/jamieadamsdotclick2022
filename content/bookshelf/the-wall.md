+++
A  dystopian tale of a future England that has been ravaged by climate change.  Rising sea levels necessitate construction of a monstrous wall around the island, patrolled by ‘Defenders’ who are tasked with keeping out any stray folk who would like to try for the safety of the shires inside.

Clever concept with vast potential for world and character building, but ultimately just shallow & boring.
