The words, sentences, phrases, opinions & statements on this website are my creation. They do not reflect the beliefs of my employer, or anyone else I am professionally or personally related to.

With that said, you should also consider the following:

## Opinions Change

This blog goes back many years. Like all well adjusted people, my opinions and beliefs have changed over time. What I said five years ago probably isn’t what I believe now.

## I am probably wrong

You should not take anything on this site as expert advice. I am an expert in very few things – therefore my opinions or statements may be factually or materially wrong. Feel free to tell me that I am wrong. Even better, tell me why I am wrong. I’ll be happy to set the record straight.

## I’m not responsible for what I link to

If I link to somewhere and it offends you in some way, steals your dog or mugs your computer – that’s not my fault. Obviously I’ll try not to link to dodgy places, but the internet is a strange place and I don’t have the time to constantly monitor my links. Similarly, external links will take you to places with different privacy and data collection policies. It’s on you to check that out. Your problems are not my fault

If I say something, and you do it, and it results in you breaking something (or the law), that makes you the fool not me.

## Licence

You are free to:

- Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

With the following conditions:

- Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
- No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

## Privacy

This site does not intentionally collect any user-identifiable information. I don’t use cookies, external analytics, social beacons or any other tracking related technologies. That’s why there is no cookie banner. That being said:

### Analytics & Automatically Logged Information

When you visit a website, any website, your browser sends information to the server. It’s up to individual websites what they do with this information, but it is always sent. I use a tool called Plausible to analyse traffic to my site. I host this myself, and the information is not shared with any third party. Plausible does not collect IP addresses, nor does it allow me to identify or track specific users. It tells me what pages have been visited, how often and who referred the person to that page. This collection is fully compliant with GDPR. You can read more about how Plausible treats data here.

In the interests of absolute transparency, you should know that your browser automatically sends other information to my server which is stored in the server logs. This data includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, the date and time of your request, and information about what pages you interacted with. The server logs are purged irrevocably every 30 days. It is my understanding (not a lawyer) that this collection falls under the ‘legitimate use’ provisions of the GDPR.

## Affiliate Links

I occasionally use affiliate links in my posts. When you click on these links I get a small percentage of the sale. Amazon would like me to say the following:
