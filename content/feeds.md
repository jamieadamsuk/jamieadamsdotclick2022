### What’s this all about?

Web feeds, also known as RSS feeds, are a way to subscribe to content and have it delivered to you, instead of having to remember to check the site for updates. Feeds work in companion with a ’feed reader’, which automatically checks for new content and retrieves it on your behalf.

The Guardian, The BBC, Reddit, YouTube, The Atlantic and hundreds of thousands of small independent publishers are already providing feeds for you.

Here are links to my feeds:

- Essays: [https://jamieadams.click/essays/index.xml](https://jamieadams.click/essays/index.xml)
- Bookshelf: [https://jamieadams.click/bookshelf/index.xml](https://jamieadams.click/bookshelf/index.xml)

I wrote about why I like RSS here: [RSS makes the web tolerable again](https://hinged.blog/essays/rss-makes-the-web-tolerable-again/)

Here are some feed readers that I recommend. Each offers a generous free tier, so you can dive in without paying a thing:

- NewsBlur
